## Research Interests

I'm currently working as a research scientist at Google in Climate & Energy. I'm interested in ocean alkalinity enhancement and related technologies.
I studied Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of Bristol and obtained my PhD in Biophysics in 2007. 
I went on to work as a research fellow with Prof. David Baker at the University of Washington to study the protein structure prediction. 
I joined Google in 2012 and worked with Viren Jain on creating a neuron-level map of fly and mouse brain tissue using computer vision and machine learning. 
In 2020 I joined the Climate and Energy team and have been doing research there since with Chris Van Arsdale and John Platt.
