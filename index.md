# Michael D. Tyka, PhD
## Research Interests

I'm currently working as a research scientist at Google in Climate & Energy. I'm interested in ocean alkalinity enhancement and related technologies.

I studied Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of Bristol and obtained my PhD in Biophysics in 2007. 
I went on to work as a research fellow with Prof. David Baker at the University of Washington to study the structure of protein molecules. 
I Google in 2012 and worked on creating a neuron-level map of fly and mouse brain tissue using computer vision and machine learning. In 2020 I joined the
Climate and Energy team and have been doing research there since.
