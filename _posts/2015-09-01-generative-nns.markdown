We're seeing a proliferation of generative neural networks of all kinds, producing interesting content in various media. Below is a collection of links to various examples of recent work in this field. If you're aware of others (I'm sure there are plenty more), <a href="mailto:mike.tyka@gmail.com">email</a>/<a href="http://www.twitter.com/mtyka">tweet</a> me and I'll add it here.
