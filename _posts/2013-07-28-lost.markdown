## Lost

I once knew a man

a confident leader

an unstoppable force

with the gift of gab

He inspired crowds

herded cats 

to higher goals.

I looked up to him,

followed him,

eager to learn.



I once knew a man

he stood solidly

flying high he loved to

dance with the sirens

their pull ever seductive.

Curiosity became style

style became habit

habit became crutch

crutch became reliance.



The eroded walls

caved easily when

the earthquake struck.

Confused and betrayed he flailed.

Ego and pride ablaze

The embers flew

and one by one

set fire to the bridges

moats grew around the castle ruins

like callus walling off the world



I once knew a man.



I see him shine through,

every now and again,

a glimpse of the past

peeking through ruin walls

inside the paper thin skin crawling

blistered and bruised,

scratching, picking,

clinging to distorted reality





I miss him

I wonder if I will ever meet him again
