Mike Tyka studied Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of Bristol. He obtained his PhD in Biophysics in 2007 and went on to work as a research fellow at the University of Washington and has been studying the structure and dynamics of protein molecules. In particular, he has been interested in protein folding and has been writing computer simulation software to better understand this fascinating process. Protein folding is the way our genetic code is interpreted from an abstract sequence of data into the functional enzymes and nano machines that drive our bodies. Mike currently works on machine learning at Google in Seattle. 


Mike became involved in creating sculpture and art in 2009 when he helped design and construct [Groovik's Cube](http://www.miketyka.com/?p=groovikscube), a 35ft tall, functional, multi-player Rubik's cube. Since then he's co-founded ALTSpace, a shared art studio in Seattle, and started creating [sculptures of protein molecules](http://www.miketyka.com/?s=molecule). He hopes to capture some of the hidden beauty of these amazing nanomachines, make it accessible to the general public, and maybe act as inspiration for those who want to learn more about the biochemistry that make life possible.


Since 2015 Mike has also begun working with artificial neural networks as an artistic medium and tool. He created some of the first largescale artworks using [Iterative DeepDream](http://www.miketyka.com/?s=deepdream) and collaborated to create a pioneering immersive projection installations using Generative Adversarial Networks ["Archive Dreaming"](http://www.miketyka.com/?p=salt).
